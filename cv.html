                            worked for AgeUK, the NHS, Open Democracy, Food Ethics Council, Greenwich University, and Comic Relief. For Comic Relief I returned for three campaigns (Red Nose Day and

                <h3>Skills &amp; interests</h3>


                <h5>Technologies</h5>

                <p>I am proficient with many components of open source full stack development. I have worked with Drupal for over 8 years, but recently I work more with Python Frameworks - Flask and
                    Django. I try not to be a language zealot, believing instead that selecting the best tool and platform for a project is more important than the language it's written in. Similarly,
                    I use many different database systems including mySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Neo4J.</p>

                <p>On the front end I am experienced with many javascript libraries (NodeJS, jQuery, D3.js) and MVC frameworks (AngularJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS).</p>

                <p>I enjoy building interfaces to explore geospatial data, and have worked with PostGIS, QGIS and CartoDB. The <a
                        href="http://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/collection-specimens/resource/05ff2255-c38a-40c9-b657-4ccb55ab2feb?view_id=f4301659-ef2a-4239-a0d5-cce3c46f7a30">geospatial search on the
                    Museum data portal</a> is built using the same open source components as CartoDB, and is capable of rendering many millions of data points on one map.</p>

                <h5>Agile & Open Source</h5>

                <p>I am an advocate of agile and open source development. Prior to joining the Museum I worked on many projects managed using Scrum, and have brought that experience to the Museum. For
                    some Biodiversity Informatics Group projects with smaller teams, I implemented a Kanban-based approach - an approach which has now been widely adopted throughout the Museum. I set
                    up and administer the Museum's Github account, to better distribute the Museum's open source software.</p>


                <h5>Open Data</h5>

                <p>I have worked for many years to help get the Museum to release it's collection and research under an open licence. Outside of the Museum I have worked on my own sites which
                    aggregate open data sources - like richseam.com and mpreportcard.co.uk. The financial interests data I collated was recently included in a Transparency International white paper. I
                    am actively involved in the Open Data community, and have helped and advised two of the startups in the Open Data challenge series. PiC won the Jobs challenge; Rabble got through
                    to the final three of the Heritage+Culture challenge.</p>
