Lead Architect of the Natural History Museum's Data Portal, building an open access platform to release all of the Museum's collections and research data.

As project manager, I introduced an agile (kanban-based) approach.  It was the first Museum project to be run using a fully agile methodology, and the site launched on-time, under-budget and with all functionality delivered.

We also implemented an open access approach, with the project milestones, [kanban board](https://waffle.io/naturalhistorymuseum/ckanext-nhm) and [source code](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum) publicly available.
