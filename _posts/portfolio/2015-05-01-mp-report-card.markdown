A report evaluating an MPs performance in the 2010-2015 parliamentary session, with metrics including financial interests, expenses and number of votes.

The data comes from a variety of open data sources and websites.  The financial interests had to be scraped directly from the Commons’ Register of Members’ Financial Interests, and this dataset is [released as open data](https://github.com/sparkd/mp-financial-interests).
