I was co-founder and developer of Richseam, a music recommendation engine using real connections between artists. Artists work with those who inspire them, bands share members, musicians produce and tour together.
   
We mined a variety of open data sources to graph two million relationships between 170,000 musicians. The site was listed as a top-50 startup at the 2013 Pioneers festival.
