Once a year the Natural History Museum hosts <em>Science Uncovered</em>, an evening celebration of it's science and research.  Every year my team - the Biodiversity Informatics Group - takes part. But as most of our work is computer-based, we spend the evening trying to entice people over to look at monitor screens. Not an easy task when visitors have an entire Museum of cutting-edge science to explore. 
This year I wanted to do something a bit different, and try to find a way to communicate our work in a more engaging way.

Working with <a href="https://twitter.com/ivvetm">Ivvet Modinou</a> (then the NHM's Science Communication Manager - now Head of Engagement at the BSA) we came up with the idea of a live digitisation pipeline, showing every step of the process of getting the Museum's 80 million specimens online.       
 
It starts with taking a Specimen from the collection
